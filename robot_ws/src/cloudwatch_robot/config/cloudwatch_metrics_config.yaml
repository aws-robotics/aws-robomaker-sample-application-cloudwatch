# This is the storage resolution level for presenting metrics in CloudWatch.
# Valid values are 1 and 60. Setting this to 1 specifies this metric as a
# high-resolution metric, so that CloudWatch stores the metric with sub-minute
# resolution down to one second. Setting this to 60 specifies this metric as a
# regular-resolution metric, which CloudWatch stores at 1-minute resolution.
# Currently, high resolution is available only for custom metrics. For more
# information about high-resolution metrics, see http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/publishingMetrics.html
