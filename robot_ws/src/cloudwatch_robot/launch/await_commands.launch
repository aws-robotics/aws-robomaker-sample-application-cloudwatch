        Launch command for a Turtlebot to await commands with monitoring enabled.

        Use this with bookstore_turtlebot_navigation for routing though 
        the bookstore. Or use with remote steering via RQT or RViz 
        launchers or on the terminal with turtlebot3_teleop.

       Using simulation time means nodes initialized after this
       will not use the system clock for its ROS clock and 
       instead wait for simulation ticks. 

       See http://wiki.ros.org/Clock

       Note: set to false for deploying to a real robot.
